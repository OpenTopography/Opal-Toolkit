Opal Toolkit
----------------
Opal is a toolkit for wrapping scientific applications as Web services on Cluster, Grid and Cloud resources with ease. Users may access these software as a service using simple Web service APIs from their custom application and workflow environment.

This is the OpenTopography fork of the Opal toolkit originally developed by Sriram Krishnan at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (www.sdsc.edu) at UC San Diego.

In this directory you will find the core Opal package implemented in Java, which includes both client and server sides.
